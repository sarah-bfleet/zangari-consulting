            <p>
              Straight out of undergrad, Jessica took a part time tutoring job
              and transformed that into an academic prep business that employed
              a team of 50 people. After successfully selling her start up, she
              went to Columbia Business School and earned her MBA. She put that
              degree to use as a management consultant and innovation strategist
              where she worked with Fortune 500 executives to develop new
              products and services as well as helped organizations learn how to
              foster creativity and nurture more innovative corporate cultures.
              Jessica has delivered speeches, workshops and coaching for clients
              including Coca Cola, Pfizer, American Express, Hasbro, Johnson and
              Johnson, LVMH, and Hearst among many others. She has spoken to
              audiences of hundreds of people throughout the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              She now brings her expertise to audiences using a unique approach
              helping people capture unlikely connections, leading to fresh
              thinking and disruptive ideas. Everyone will learn practical
              skills on how to actually come up with new ideas, how to embody
              the behaviors that foster creativity, and the practical frameworks
              to implement those ideas that can be applied immediately.
